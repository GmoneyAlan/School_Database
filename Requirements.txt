Gmoney just made a new school in the pandemic where he wants to make a app, the students can 
sign up for classes, check the number of students and the name of the professor. The students can
 also check their grades thru the app. Another feature we want is the student should be able to 
modify their profile on the app, like classes and sign up for clubs. A student can be suspended, 
be put on probation, or even kicked out of the school. This can be accomplished by the 
President or if the professor puts in the request for it. 

A student is considered full-time if they are atleast taking 4 classes, if they are taking less 
classes than a student is considered part-time. One extra condition I need is the cap for classes 
is 6 classes for a student. This cap can be overriden if a student puts in a request to be able 
to take more than six students. The system then goes thru the students history to see if they
are capable of taking such a class. This type of student is called a super-student.

Now for faculty on this app im gonna need the following, President, and Professor. Both faculty 
can check each student and their profile. A professor now can put in a request to drop a student
from their class, this request can only be accepted by the president. The professor can teach a 
maximum of 3 classes. Their classes are divided into tiers where there are a total of 3 tiers. 
The importance of a tier is it determines what category the class falls in and it provides a cap
in students. For example we the following tiers:
					1.) Basics		CAP: 200 Students
					2.) Lower Division	CAP: 75  Students
					3.) High Division	CAP: 30  Students

Finally this database must have chat system. By this I mean the app has a tab where a student, 
can join a global chat for all the school, a chat for their class, groups made between the 
groups and 1-1 chats. The student must have the option to be able to disable profanity messages,
block an individual, and block messages with words of their choosing. 

Extra feature the app must be able to give reminders to a student/faculty on the device.
